This sample code is for generating Voronoi diagrams in C#. 

More information about Voronoi Diagrams (used in wide range of scientific domains, such as biology, informatics, data science and geometry) could be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram.

This implementation is just for illustrational purposes and could optimized further for performance, as well as the parameters could be changed to be passed from the outside.
